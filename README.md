## Overview

This repository provides an RT-Thread Studio board support package for the GD32H77D Gino board, based on RT-Thread 5.3.0. Shared RT-Thread, GD32 libraries, and offline packages are combined with 16 independent projects for peripherals and application demos.

The projects cover the base template, UART, I2C, SPI, QSPI flash, SD card, CAN, PWM, RTC, SDRAM, USB device/host, LVGL display/touch, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, camera, MQTT, and an integrated factory demo, with both Studio and MDK5 project support.

Each project contains its own configuration, Studio metadata, MDK5 project files, application code, and README. The project README covers the hardware, device interfaces, example operation, and expected behavior.

## RT-Thread Studio

1. Open RT-Thread Studio and install the GD32H77D-Gino **v1.0.0** board support package.
2. Select "File -> New -> RT-Thread Project -> Based on Board", choose `GD32H77D-Gino`, and create an example or template project.

   ![Create a board project in RT-Thread Studio](figures/rt-thread-studio-project.png)

3. Build with GNU Arm Embedded 13.3; connect the UART1 console at 115200-8-N-1.
4. Connect DAP-Link, select target `GD32H77DIW` and BIN mode, then download `Debug/rtthread.bin` at `0x08000000`.
5. For debugging, configure the GDB executable from the GNU Arm Embedded 13.3 toolchain, as shown below.

   ![Configure GDB from the GNU Arm Embedded 13.3 toolchain](figures/1789024939745.png)

Studio builds generate `Debug/rtthread.bin` for download and retain `Debug/rtthread.elf` for debugging. The BIN image starts at the boot entry at `0x08000000`, which provides compatibility with different chip revisions; the application vector table is at offset `0x10000` within the image (`0x08010000` in Flash). Set the BIN download address to `0x08000000`.

## MDK5 Build

First install the [GigaDevice device support pack](tools/mdk_pack/GigaDevice.GD32H77x_78x_DFP.0.6.1.pack).

The `rt-thread` and `libraries` directories are shared to avoid duplicating them in every project under `projects` as the SDK grows. Opening an MDK project directly before linking these shared directories results in missing-file errors. Complete the following steps:

1. Use [Env](https://club.rt-thread.org/ask/question/5699.html) to run `mklinks.bat`, creating symbolic links to the `rt-thread` and `libraries` directories.
2. Check that the `rt-thread` and `libraries` folder icons appear in the project directory.
3. Use [Env](https://club.rt-thread.org/ask/question/5699.html) to run `scons --target=mdk5` and update the MDK5 project files.

Use Env 2.0 or later ([download](https://www.rt-thread.org/download.html#download-rt-thread-env-tool)). MDK uses Arm Compiler 6 and requires GigaDevice `GD32H77x_78x_DFP` 0.6.1. See the [project guide](docs/project-guide/README.md) for the complete steps.
